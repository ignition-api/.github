# Contributing to ignition-api

As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)
- [Got a question?](#got-a-question)
- [Issues and Bugs](#found-a-bug)
- [Creating a Pull Request](#pull-requests)
- [Style Guide](#style-guide)

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep **ignition-api** open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ignition-api/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Got a question?

Please join us on or [Discussions](https://github.com/ignition-api/discussions/discussions).

## Found a bug?

If you find a bug or if something is missing in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue, or even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#pull-requests) with a fix.

## Pull Requests

In **ignition-api** we use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) as main versioning workflow.

1. Fork the repository
1. Create a new branch for each feature, fix or improvement
1. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **main** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a pull request for each branch.

This allows us to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests SHOULD adhere to the [Conventional Commits specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/).
